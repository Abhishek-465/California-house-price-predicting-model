## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict housing prices in California using a simple Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Our goal is to demonstrate the basic steps of a machine learning project, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [California Housing Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices), which contains various features such as median housing price, average rooms, and more. The dataset is loaded and explored within the Jupyter Notebook to understand the characteristics of the data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the following Python libraries are used and can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook california_house_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Linear Regression model, and make predictions.

## Results

After training the model, the notebook provides insights into the model's performance and predictions. Visualization techniques are used to analyze the results, helping you understand the relationships between different features and the predicted housing prices.
